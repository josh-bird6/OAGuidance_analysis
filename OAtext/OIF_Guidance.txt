Guidance for Interim Outcome Agreements for Colleges and Universities 
AY 2020-21
Foreword
1. This guidance outlines the steps required to ensure an interim agreement is in place between SFC and each university1, college or college region which captures, at a high level, contributions, impact and outcomes, and provides assurance on use of allocated funding in AY 2020-21. It follows the recent publication of the report from the first phase of the SFC Review of Coherent Provision and Sustainability2. 
2. We recognise that colleges and universities are working under emergency conditions as they continue to respond to the COVID crisis, deliver a blended learning approach, ensure the well-being of students and staff, and deliver an education-led economic recovery for Scotland.  Through this approach to the interim Outcome Agreements we are taking steps to support all our institutions during extraordinary times.
3. We worked with sector representatives during phase one of SFC’s Review of Coherent Provision to jointly establish and agree an Outcome and Impact Framework for this year. A key message we heard was for a more meaningful, outcome focused, streamlined approach to accountability and reporting in future. We will pursue these discussions during phase two of the review.
4. The Framework for the interim Outcome Agreements for AY2020-21 seeks to: 
* Focus on the delivery of outcomes and impact for students.
* Ensure colleges and universities outline their contributions to a more focused set of priority issues. 
* Promote and reflect individual and collective responses to recovery with narrative on commitments, deliverables, and expected impact. 
* Ensure transparency and clear accountability for public funding.
5. This Framework represents a commitment to realign priorities with what will be needed to support economic recovery, to support those already in the education system (at schools, colleges and universities) during the crisis period, those who may need upskilling or reskilling opportunities and those who may be looking to re-enter employment. At the same time we expect colleges and universities to continue to widen access, deliver high quality research and ensure a high quality learning experience for all students that will in most cases be different in shape, structure and mode to previous years. 
6. We are particularly aware of the need to maintain volumes of provision this year when the economy will be in a recovery period, to allow students to continue to access the learning and employability skills that will ensure a pathway to employment when jobs become available, or a route back into employment for those who may now be out of work, or returning to work, through upskilling or reskilling. At the same time SFC seeks to promote and support a diverse and sustainable education sector.
Arrangements for AY 2020-21 at a glance
* Introduces a new Outcome and Impact Framework which aims to capture – at a high level – deliverables, impact and outcomes, and to give assurance on the use of allocated funding in AY 2020-21. 
* Seeks contributions to a re-focused set of priorities, with an emphasis on continuing to safeguard student health and wellbeing, and support an education-led economic recovery for Scotland. 
* Signals a move away from excessive reporting, particularly if the information is available elsewhere.
* Reflects an ongoing commitment to fair access and transitions; quality learning and teaching; student engagement; equalities and inclusion; and impactful research and innovation.
* A focus on maintaining baselines where this is possible. 
* SFC will issue a bespoke measures table to each institution with AY 2018-19 baselines. 
* Enables institutions to demonstrate their impact in terms that are relevant to their particular situation and mission.
* Is no more than 15 pages in length.
Discuss with your Outcome Agreement Manager
7. Institutions should liaise with their dedicated Outcome Agreement Manager on any issues or requests for flexibility in responding to deadlines. Contact details are available on our website.

Arrangements for AY 2020-21 
Shorter outcome agreements focused on key priorities and commitments
8. SFC is aware of the competing demands that are impacting on institutions and want to ensure the Outcome Agreement reporting requirement is a proportionate request. We have therefore restricted the key policy priorities we expect to be covered in the interim OA for this year. 
9. We are seeking an ongoing commitment/statement of intent from colleges and universities to deliver on key sector priorities and outcomes for students, for research, for economic recovery and social renewal and for responsive and collaborative institutions.  The priority list is pared back and includes:
* Fair access and transitions.
* Quality learning and teaching.
* Learning with impact – students are equipped and ready to take up appropriate employment in the future.
* Student participation and engagement in their educational experience.
* Equalities and inclusion.
* High quality research and innovation.
* Meeting future skills needs, including upskilling and reskilling.
* Responding to the climate emergency.
Appropriate measures to assess impact
10. The SFC Outcome and Impact Framework refers to the expectations and the national measures related to each priority outcome.  
11. For colleges the national measures are: 
* Activity - Credits delivered (Core / ESF / Core + ESF).
* Widening Access -Volume and proportion of Credits delivered to learners in the most deprived 10% postcode areas (SIMD10).
* The volume and proportion of Credits delivered to care-experienced learners.
* Senior Phase - number of senior phase age pupils studying vocational qualifications delivered by colleges.
* Achievement - proportion of enrolled students successfully achieving a recognised qualification (FT & PT).
* Articulation - the number and proportion of successful learners who have achieved HNC or HND qualifications articulating to degree level courses with advanced standing.
* In work/destination - the number and proportion of full-time college qualifiers in work, training and/or further study 3-6 months after qualifying.
* Satisfaction – using the SSES Survey - the percentage of students overall, satisfied with their college experience.
12. For Universities the national measures are:
* Total number of Scottish domiciled undergraduate entrants.
* The number and proportion of Scotland-domiciled learners articulating from college to degree level courses with advanced standing.
* The number and proportion of Scotland-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from the 20% most deprived postcodes.
* The number and proportion of Scotland-domiciled undergraduate entrants that are care-experienced.
* The number and proportion of full-time first year Scotland-domiciled undergraduate entrants returning to study in year two.
* The difference (+/-) from the individual institution benchmark figure for students satisfied with the overall quality of their course of study in the National Student Survey.
* The number and proportion of Scotland-domiciled graduates entering positive destinations.
* The number and proportion of Scotland-domiciled full-time first degree graduates entering professional occupations.
* The number of Scotland-domiciled qualifiers at undergraduate level.
13. Our approach in this year recognises the extraordinary circumstances we are operating within. To support institutions we have pared back the national measures and focused on key priorities. Nevertheless recognising the current situation means there may be other matters where we will require additional statements of intent around your commitments, and occasionally separate reporting, but we will give you appropriate notice of requirements throughout the year. For example reporting on the use of the Flexible Workforce Development Fund or the Upskilling allocations.
14. Outcome Agreement Managers will issue a national measures table to each college, college region and university with key data, including AY 2018-19 baselines. We will also issue updated tables to include AY 2019-20 baselines early in 2021. Only those national measures outlined will continue to be a priority however. SFC will, as a matter of course, continue to monitor all performance measures we currently have in addition to those identified as priority.
15. The Technical guidance is attached at Annex B and provides updates on the measures relevant for this year. 
No target setting for AY 2020-21
16. We confirmed earlier in the year that SFC would not require targets for this emergency year, in recognising the likely impact of the pandemic. 
17. We are still asking for a commitment from colleges and universities to maintain, wherever possible, the levels of performance as in the AY 2018-19 baselines.
Contribution to economic recovery and social renewal
18. The other sections in the Framework invite a narrative that both describes the contribution colleges and universities will make to support economic recovery and social renewal in AY 2020-21 and the expected impact of these contributions. 
19. This emergency year will require flexibility and applied ways of learning, so students can access opportunities at a time that suits them and to lay strong foundations for moving into the job market when this opens up. There also needs to be a focus on upskilling and reskilling to allow routes to new and changing industries and jobs as they emerge.
20. We also want to know how colleges and universities are responding to ensure the health and well-being of students and staff as they progress through this challenging year. 
21. In responding to this section of the Framework we expect a brief narrative in your Outcome Agreement summarising how you have responded to the immediate challenges of the current emergency. Specifically we would like to better understand your commitments and contribution to economic recovery. We request a short, focused response in line with your own institution’s particular mission, strategy, and context responding to the points below, alongside any other relevant information. We are particularly interested in new collaborative and innovative approaches you have developed during the period since March 2020. We have prepared a set of prompt questions to guide responses in this section.
Prompt questions
22. Use the following as a guide:
* Which stakeholders are you working with to ensure that course provision remains responsive to shifting needs of employers/industry?
* What specific needs employers/industry have identified, both short-term and longer-term, and how you are adapting or shifting your provision in response? (with particular reference to courses starting in January/February)
* Which groups, or issues, are you particularly seeking to respond to e.g. those recently becoming unemployed, young people entering the workplace for the first time, those who have previously been furthest from the job market, upskilling, reskilling, retraining?
* How you are managing the work-based learning and practical aspects of course provision and ensuring students are prepared for the workplace given ongoing constraints during this year.
* How are you maintaining the quality of the student learning experience and how are you monitoring student engagement with their programme of study with the college or university?
Self-evaluation reports on delivery of AY 2019-20 Outcome Agreement commitments including impact of COVID-19 
23. In a normal year, colleges and universities would submit an annual self-evaluation report to the SFC by the end of October. This year Universities had a submission date of 30 October 2020, while colleges paused this work as it was embedded within the Quality Framework requirements.
24. We recognise that these self-evaluation reports provide helpful information to SFC and to the SFC Board and we have, therefore, decided to ask both colleges and universities to submit a self-evaluation report this year. 
25. The date for submitting self-evaluations is now 20 January 2021. We can also apply further flexibility to these timelines if needed. These requests should be routed via your Outcome Agreement Manager. We expect that you will have already prepared this information for internal reporting requirements and we will also be flexible with regard to the format of these reports. 
26. Annex A describes the self-evaluation reporting requirements for colleges and for universities.
