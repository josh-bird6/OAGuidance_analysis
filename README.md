# Outcome Agreement Analysis  
This short project analysed the evolving nature of Outcome Agreements (OAs), which are the primary means by which colleges and universities in Scotland show what they deliver in return for their public investment. In other words, their value for money. The methods comprised both text and sentiment analyses, and the outputs included word clouds in addition to a variety of charts.

All the information in this repo came directly from OAs, which are made publicly available annually and can be found on SFC's webiste here: http://www.sfc.ac.uk/funding/outcome-agreements/outcome-agreements.aspx
